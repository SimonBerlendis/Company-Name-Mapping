    "The case study is quite simple. A list of company names is provided. All these names were manually written. As a result, some of the names refer to the same entity but written differently. For instance, division names are written alongside the company name (i.e. ALTRAN INNOVACION for ALTRAN). Or the names can be written in non-standard way, with non-english characters or with common naming (i.e. 'INC.' or '& CO'). \n",
