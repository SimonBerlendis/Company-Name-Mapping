# Company-Name-Mapping

This project is used to follow my progress on a simple case study that I was given during an interview.
The purpose of this case study is to group the company names that are coming from the entity using a
dataset of manually-written names.
The resultint algorithm should be able to map the company names to their possible common entities. 
This project contains a spreadsheet with 5000 raw company names.
Jupyter notebooks are used here as a fully-documented proof-of-concept.
