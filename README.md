# Company-Name-Mapping

This project is used to follow my progress on a simple case study that I was given during an interview.
The purpose of this case study is to group the company names that are coming from the entity using a
dataset of manually-written company names.
This project contains a spreadsheet with 5000 raw company names.
The result should be a map of the company names to their common entity or to a list of common entities. 

Jupiter notebooks is used here as fully-documented proof-of-concept documents.
