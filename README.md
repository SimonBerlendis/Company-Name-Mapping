# Company-Name-Mapping

This project contains the solution for a case study that I was given during an interview.
The goal of this case study is to group the company names that are coming from the entity using a dataset of manually-written names.
The resulting algorithm should be able to map the company names to their possible common entities. 

This project contains :
<!--- * A spreadsheet with nearly 5000 raw company names -->
 * A jupyter notebook which document my approach for this case study.
<!--- * A python script containing the resulting algorithm  -->
